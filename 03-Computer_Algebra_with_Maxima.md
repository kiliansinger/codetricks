# Computeralgebra

Computeralgebra is the use of computer programs to perform symbolic analysis and
solving of equations and expressions.

In our moodle system we use Maxima, a powerfull opensource
Computeralgebrasystem.

In research we often resort to Mathematica which is a commercial system.
But if you own a raspberry pi, then you just need to run

```bash
sudo apt install wolfram-engine
```

We will install maxima https://maxima.sourceforge.io/download.html. Again you can just click the codetour link (if you open the file in vs-code source code view)...

Then open the folder [04maxima](./03-maxima) for some example files with plotting, integrating, derivatives and performing Taylor series expansions.
